If Empowering Auras is equipped, an additional element will track its stacks as well. The icon will blink when the buff is under 3 seconds to remind you to reapply an aura, since it refreshes all stacks when you do:

If Empowered Empowerment is equipped, the bar will glow when at full charge. If you find the effect distracting, you can disable it under Empowered Empowerment / Pulse.
